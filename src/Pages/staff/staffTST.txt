Crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a rubber room and told me to sit in the corner. In the corner, there was a round table and on the round table, there was a glass bowl and in the glass bowl, there was a silver key. I took the silver key and they said, 'Now you're sane.' Crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a padded cell and told me to make myself comfortable. So I went to sleep on the bed and when I woke up, I was in a straight-jacket. I told them I was sane and they said, 'Now you're crazy.' Crazy? I was crazy once. They put me in a maze and told me to find my way out. I found the way out in five minutes and they said, 'You're a genius!' Crazy? I was crazy once.
